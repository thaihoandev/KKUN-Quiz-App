- **Frontend** communicates exclusively via WebSocket: authentication, PDF upload, quiz session, real-time question delivery, answer submission, leaderboard updates.  
- **Backend** orchestrates sessions, validates JWT auth over socket, manages quiz state, interacts with Redis, and delegates PDF processing to the AI service.  
- **AI Extraction Service** ingests PDFs (text or scanned), uses OCR if needed, and calls a large language model to parse and normalize multiple-choice questions into structured JSON.  
- **Redis** handles shared state, room coordination, leaderboards, and can be used for scaling with pub/sub or streams.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java 21, Spring Boot 3.x, WebSocket (STOMP or raw), Spring Security (JWT over socket), Resilience4j, Micrometer, structured JSON logging (SLF4J/Logback)  
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript, Vite, WebSocket client (or SockJS/STOMP), optional state helpers (Zustand / React Query fallback), ESLint, Prettier, Husky  
- **State & Cache:** Redis (session/room state, pub-sub, dedupe, caching question banks)  
- **Persistence:** PostgreSQL (recommended with Flyway migrations) or JSON-backed store for simplicity  
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions  
- **Observability:** Prometheus (via Micrometer), health endpoints, correlation ID tracing  
- **Security:** JWT, rate limiting, input sanitization, secure file handling

## ðŸ§° Incomming
- **AI Extraction Service:** Python 3.11+ (FastAPI or minimal HTTP), `pdfplumber` + Tesseract OCR, integration with LLMs (OpenAI or local), prompt engineering
